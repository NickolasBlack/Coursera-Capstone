The goal is to find the neighborhoods that Citi Bikes are most often used, the average age of current citi bike users, the top 10 venues in the neighborhoods with the most citi bike traffic, and to cluster the neighborhoods using k-means clustering.\n\nThis project is designed to target bicycle enthusiasts who are looking to relocate to NYC and bicycle businesses that are looking for venues to advertise their products and services. The descriptive charateristics of the individual user data will provide advertisers with an idea of a targeted demographic for advertisements. The location data will provide bike users with an idea of which neighborhoods bikes are more or less readily available and where they can connect and network with fellow biking enthusiasts.\n\nWe will focus on the neighborhoods with the highest number of bicycle traffic, a description of the people who use the bike sharing program, and the top 10 venues in the neighborhoods with the most traffic. \n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": ""}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": ""}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
